  * "Politics is a gateway to a broader and better understanding of human nature, society, and the world." This idea has inspired each edition of UNDERSTANDING POLITICS: IDEAS, INSTITUTIONS, AND ISSUES. Thomas Magstadt’s book provides in-depth coverage of contemporary political issues and calls attention to the more enduring underlying questions. With its intense, engaging "politics are pertinent" theme and current, cutting-edge coverage, the Eleventh Edition will fascinate you with its coverage of three fundamental premises: 1) politics is a pervasive force in modern society; 2) government is too critically important to be left in the hands of a few; and 3) everyone has both the opportunity and the obligation to participate in public life in a democracy. The Eleventh Edition focuses on such vital concepts as democracy, dictatorship, citizenship, voting behavior, elections, leadership, ideologies, war, revolution, world politics, and public policy.
